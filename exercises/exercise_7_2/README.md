# Chapter 7 exercise 2

Write a calculator program that calculates the sum, difference or product of two integers. The program asks for the type of calculation first (1 = sum, 2 = difference, 3 = product). After calculation, the result is printed on the screen and the program returns to prompt for the next calculation.

You should write a function for each calculation, prompting for the numbers, performing the desired calculation and printing the answer on the screen. The program is terminated by entering a negative number just like in the previous exercise.

**Hint:**
You can use the previous exercise as the body of your program. The functions carrying out the calculations and printing do not take any parameters or return any value.

_Example output_

```
1: sum of two numbers
2: difference of two numbers
3: product of two numbers
<0: terminate the program
Select calculation:1
Enter the first number:55
Enter the second number:33
55 + 33 = 88

1: sum of two numbers
2: difference of two numbers
3: product of two numbers
<0: terminate the program
Select calculation:2
Enter the first number:14
Enter the second number:41
14 - 41 = -27

1: sum of two numbers
2: difference of two numbers
3: product of two numbers
<0: terminate the program
Select calculation:3
Enter the first number:4
Enter the second number:5
4 * 5 = 20

1: sum of two numbers
2: difference of two numbers
3: product of two numbers
<0: terminate the program
Select calculation:-1
Terminating the program...
