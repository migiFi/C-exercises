# Chapter 4 exercise 1

Write a program that prompts the user for two integers and prints the sum, difference and product of the numbers on the screen.

**Hint:**
This exercise is an excellent opportunity for practicing how to print several variables in one printf() statement. The variables in the program are integer variables.

_Example output_

```
Enter the first number:83
Enter the second number:78

83+78=161
83-78=5
83*78=6474
```
