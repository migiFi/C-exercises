# Chapter 6 exercise 3

Write a program that asks for the students' exam scores (using integers 4 to 10) and calculates the average. The program must accept scores until entry is terminated by a negative integer. Finally, the program prints out the number of scores and the calculated average with two decimal places of precision.

**Hint:**
You can write your program using either the while or do...while statement.

_Example output_

Enter score (4-10):10
Enter score (4-10):4
Enter score (4-10):4
